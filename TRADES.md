# Trades Page & Position Management System

The **Trades Page** (`/trades`) provides live position tracking, manual trade creation, trade execution management, auto TP/SL hit monitoring, automatic journal logging, full trade property modification, and trade archiving.

## 📌 Overview & Key Features

1. **3-Tab Navigation Architecture**:
   - **Active Trades**: Running position alerts with live prices, position sizing, margin, leverage, UPNL ($ & %), TP/SL level indicators, full edit, manual close, and archive actions.
   - **Closed History**: Completed trades table with final Exit Price, Realized PnL ($ and %), Exit Reason (`TP Hit`, `SL Hit`, `Manual Close`), Closed Date, full edit, and soft-delete archiving.
   - **Archive**: Soft-deleted trades table with full edit, **Restore (↩)** (returns item to Active or Closed History), and **Delete Permanently (🗑)** actions.

2. **Full Trade Property Modification (`Edit` on all tabs)**:
   - Modify **ALL** properties of any trade in **Active Trades**, **Closed History**, or **Archive**:
     - Symbol & Coin pair (e.g. `BTC_USDT`)
     - Position Direction (`Long` / `Short`)
     - Trigger Price & Fired Price
     - Entry Price, Stop Loss (SL), Take Profit (TP)
     - Margin ($) & Leverage (x)
     - Order Type (`Market`, `Limit`, `Trigger Limit`)
     - Trade Status (`Active` vs `Closed`)
     - Exit Price, Closed Reason (`TP Hit`, `SL Hit`, `Manual Close`), and Close Notes
     - Strategy & Pre-trade notes
   - Dynamic PnL recalculation: Updating price, margin, or leverage on closed or archived trades instantly recalculates Realized PnL ($ and %).

3. **Enhanced Manual Trade Entry (`+ Manual Trade`)**:
   - Create trades directly on the Trades page without requiring prior Watchlist triggers.
   - Create trades as **Active** or pre-closed (with Exit Price, Closed Reason, and auto-computed realized PnL directly into Closed History with Journal logging).

4. **Interactive Manual Trade Closure**:
   - Clicking **Close** on an active trade opens a quick modal pre-filled with the live MEXC market price.
   - Displays live preview of Realized PnL ($) and PnL (%) dynamically as exit price is confirmed or adjusted.
   - Submitting updates trade status to `closed`, logs the finished trade into the user's primary **Journal** (`trades` table), and dispatches notifications.

5. **Automated TP/SL Hit Detection & Journaling**:
   - Background poller (`/api/trade-alerts/check`) checks active trades against MEXC prices.
   - When live price crosses SL or TP:
     1. Claims level atomically.
     2. Sets trade status to `closed` with exit price and calculated realized PnL.
     3. Writes an entry directly to the **Journal** (`trades` table) with post-trade review notes.
     4. Dispatches multi-channel alert notifications (in-app, desktop toast, Discord webhooks, Telegram bots).

6. **Soft-Delete Trade Archiving**:
   - Delete action on Active Trades or Closed History soft-deletes the row into `archived_trade_alerts`.
   - Restoring moves the item back to `trade_alerts` preserving its active or closed status.
   - Permanent delete purges the record from the database.

## ⚡ Unified MEXC Market Request Pipeline

1. **Single-Payload Polling (`useMexcMarketData`)**:
   - The `/trades` page utilizes the `useMexcMarketData` unified React hook (via `useLivePrices`).
   - Batches ticker prices and contract specifications (max leverage, base coin icons, fee rates) into **1 single HTTP payload** (`/api/mexc/futures?symbols=...&with_details=true`), eliminating per-symbol loop fetches.

2. **Tab Visibility Idle Pause**:
   - Automatically detects browser tab visibility (`document.hidden`).
   - Pauses polling when the tab is inactive to prevent background network load and rate limits, instantly refreshing live prices when focused.
