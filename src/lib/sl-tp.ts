/**
 * Stop-loss / take-profit hit detection for logged trade alerts.
 *
 * A trade plan on the /trades page carries a stop_loss and a take_profit.
 * Both are checked against the live MEXC price on every poll: whichever level
 * the price crosses first notifies the user and writes a journal entry.
 *
 * Direction matters, so it is derived in one place only. There is no stored
 * side column on trade_alerts — `sideForTrigger()` maps the watchlist trigger
 * direction to the side (breaking BELOW the trigger is taken LONG, breaking
 * ABOVE is taken SHORT). That means, for a LONG position:
 *
 *      stop_loss  is BELOW the entry  → price crossing DOWN is a stop-out
 *      take_profit is ABOVE the entry → price crossing UP is a win
 *
 * and for a SHORT position the two are inverted. Getting this backwards would
 * fire the wrong alarm, so the comparison is done here and unit-tested rather
 * than duplicated at each call site.
